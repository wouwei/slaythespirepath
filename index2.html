        <h1>Naive implementation</h1>
        here, condider as before that all the pathes are on a grid... for testing , i only implemented 3 pathes , to see what happens...<br />
        - the grid is defined by rows ( or steps )  , and columns <br />
        - at step 1 ( or row 1 ) we randomly pick up for each path a column<br />
        - for the next steps , for each pathes,  we randomly choose if it goes on the left,  on the right, or it goes straight.<br />
        - watch out as if the path is on the border of the grid , there are only two choices.. eg if it is on the left of the grif the path can go straight, or on the right only...<br />
        <br /><br />
        Some issues whith this naive implementation : ( try refresh browser if it does not appear ... ) : <br />
        - pathes can cross each other. <br />
        - pathes can be extremely straight . or we can imagine they overlap on 3 or 4 steps , which might not be so nice .
        <br /><br />
        Of course comments in the js file if you wish to see it !
