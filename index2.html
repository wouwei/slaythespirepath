        <h1>Naive implementation</h1>
        And voila ... i only implemented 3 pathes , just to see what happens...<br /><br />
        In terminology i'll use : 
        <ul>
            <li> the grid is where we draw the lines. It has rows and columns.</li>
            <li>pathes as the lines ... </li>
            <li>step as a point ( a path step )  and step<b>s</b> as a grid row ( or pathes steps )  .</li>
            <li>left and right border of the grid : the path should stay inside the grid...</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        
        First we pick up a random number which corresponds to a grid column index. Then for each step a path has choice between going left, straight , or right . there are 2 constraints : 
        <ul>
            <li>when a path is on the left border, it has only two choices :  going straight or right</li>
            <li>when a path is on the right border , it has only two choices : going straight or left</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        Inside the js - i talk only about the the algo here .
        <ul>
            <li>the pathes are stored in a 2D array.  pathes[grid_row_index][path_number] = grid_column_index</li>
            <li>by using the grid column indexes for the steps, we can make a random between -1 ,0 and 1 in order to know the next path direction and step location.  </li>
            <ul>
                <li>-1 would be going on the left</li>
                <li>0 would be going straight</li>
                <li>1 would be going on the right</li>
            </ul>
            <li>the heart of the algorithm is inside the NEXT() function </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        
        Some issues whith this naive implementation : ( try to refresh browser if it does not appear ... ) : <br />
        <ul>
            <li>pathes can cross each other.</li>
            <li>pathes can be extremely straight . or we can imagine they overlap on 3 or 4 steps , which might not be so nice .</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Of course comments in the js file if you wish to see it (main2.js)!
