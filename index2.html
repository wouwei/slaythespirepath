        <h1>Naive implementation</h1>
        And voila ... i only implemented 3 pathes , just to see what happens...<br /><br />
        At the start of the algorithm : <br />
        - the grid is defined by rows ( or steps )  , and columns <br />
        - We define a 2D array , which will be : pathes[grid_row][path_number] = grid_column <br />
        - at step 1 ( or row 1 ) we randomly pick up for each path a column number<br /><br />
        The heart of the algorithm : <br />
        - for the next steps , for each pathes,  we randomly choose if it goes on the left,  on the right, or it goes straight. So 1/3 chance for each choice<br />
        - We take into account that the path can flirt with the grid border. In that case , there are only two choices.. so only 1/2 for each choice, not 1/3<br />
        - Eg for above. Path is on the left, it can goes only straight, or on the right..<br />
        -  <b>this algorithm heart is inside the NEXT() function.</b><br />
        <br /><br />
        Some issues whith this naive implementation : ( try to refresh browser if it does not appear ... ) : <br />
        - pathes can cross each other. <br />
        - pathes can be extremely straight . or we can imagine they overlap on 3 or 4 steps , which might not be so nice .
        <br /><br />
        Of course comments in the js file if you wish to see it !
