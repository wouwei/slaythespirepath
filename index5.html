        <h1>crooking pathes...</h1>

        New constraint : Pathes cannot go straight more than 4 steps ( see on the config part , sts.datas.config)<br /><br />

        Now that we have more than one constraint , we need an object which gather path informations , and which can be used by n constraints and in the path calulation..
        <ul>
            <li>
                the ''check'' object play that role , it gathers the blocked path infos from the two constraints ( ''Xcross'' , and ''straight'' )
            </li>
            <li>
                it is also used to calculate the distance 
            </li>
            <li>
                The NEXT function has been revamped.
            </li>
            <li>
                Constraints are being calculated in 2 separates functions : XCROSS() for the Xcross constraint.. CROOKING() for the straight constraint
            </li>
            <li>
                direction is now calculated in the DIRECTION() function.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        Still there are a few things to point out : 
        <ul>
            <li>
                pathes can still have more than 4 steps straight. there are some cases where there are no choices . eg 
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    we have 3 pathes 
                </li>
                <li>
                    At one grid row , all the pathes are on the same column/step .  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unfortunately , all the pathes have all 4 steps straight. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    there's no possible direction for the next step for all the pathes ...
                </li>
                <li>
                    as the pathes must go on, we drop the straight constraint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    now we have at least 1 path  with 5 steps on .... 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                path can share n steps , or can never share steps..
            </li>
        </ul>
