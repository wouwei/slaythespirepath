        <h1>THE grid</h1>
        Yes... just a grid . But it looks like a good terrain to do some path right ? <br/>
        The idea is to work with 2d arrays to make our pathes.. 
        - a first 2D array consisting on  graphical objects, or graphical coordinates ... ( this is for the drawing, it does not really belongs to the path algo)<br />
        - a second 2D array consisting on the paths and steps taken by them . ( not implemented here, but on the next example )<br /><br />
        <a href="index2.html">Naive implementation</a>
