simple explanation on how to create an algorithm to generate a slay the spire like path.. just click on index.html !

to come : 

- ~~not so naive implementation .~~
- not so naive implementation .( refactored)
- a very not so naive implementation ( yes, i'm sure to find some improvement , so in that case.. )
