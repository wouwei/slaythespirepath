simple explanation -well, trying to, in that foreign english language..  On how to create an algorithm to generate a slay the spire like path..
normaly you start with index.html , and go down to index6.html  ( those pages have explanations on them )

What i want to point out in this essay, is that as a dev I tend to complexify things and forget the goal ( having roads crossing each other a certain number of times). The quicker your reconize that you complexify things, trash the code , and restart, the better it is . Still complexifying is an important process, since it explore the limits of the algorithm....

- index to index5  is the first implementation, with a lot of steps , refactoring, and constraints adding .
- index6 is the second implementation , focusing only on the xroads. Which is the final product.
