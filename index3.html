        <h1>no crossing!</h1>
        The changes : 
        <ul>
            <li>we get a random number of pathes from 2 to 4</li>
            <li>we keep the structure pathes[row][myPathNumber] = column</li>
            <li>we add this constraint for each row : pathes[n][0] < pathes[n][1] < pathes[n][2]< etc ...</li>
            <li> which means the path 0 can never cross path 1 , which can never cross path 2 , etc.. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br /><br />
        As for the algorithm :
        <ul>
            <li>As before , a path has 3 choices , except when it is : </li>
            <ul>
                <li>on its left neightbour step : the path then can only take its left neighbour step or go on the right </li>
                <li>on its right neighbour step : the path then can only take its right neightbour step or go on the left </li>
                <li>on its left and right neighbour step : the path then can only go straight...</li>
            </ul>
            <li>we only replaced here the grid border by the path neighbour steps. </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        As we calculate the next steps for the pathes from the left path to the right path , 2 issues raised : 
        <ul>
            <li>
                the left issue :
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the path is on the same step as its left neighbour. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    we calculated that the left neighbour goes on the right 
                </li>
                <li>
                    the path has only one choice : going right
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                the border grid :
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the path is on the right border of the grid . 
                </li>
                <li>
                    we calculated that the left neighbour goes on the right
                </li>
                <li>
                    the path has only one choice : going straight .
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
       
        
        You can see the algo in main3.js, but i suggest you to see the refactored one on the next page!(main4.js)<br /><br />
