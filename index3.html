        <h1>Not so naive implementation</h1>
        First thing changed, we have randomly from 2 to 4 pathes. The concept here is to have pathes which cannot cross each others.  refresh the browser if you do not believe me..<br /><br />
        At the start of the Algorithm : <br />
        - like last time, we create a  2D array called pathes, but nesting now from 2 to (columns/2) pathes<br />
        - in the first steps , we want to be sure that the first to last path goes from the left to the right side of the grid<br />
        - said differently :<br />
        <ul>
            <li>we have pathes[row][myPathNumber] = column .</li>
            <li> row is the row on the grid, </li>
            <li>column is the column on the grid</li>
            <li>, myPathNumber : the path number..</li>
            <li>that said,  we want to respect pathes[n][0] < pathes[n][1] < pathes[n][2]< etc ...</li>
            </ul>
        <br /><br />

        At the heart of the algorithm :<br />
        - <b>we want to respect pathes[n][0] < pathes[n][1] < pathes[n][2]< etc ...</b><br />
        - we calculate steps from the left path to the right path .. <br />
        - if we take a path to calculate its next step, we need to take into account , the already calculated step from the left path, and the actual step from the right path.<br />
        - the NEXT function has been modified to take into account its neighbours.
        <ul>
            <li>
                we take the leftStep, which is the calculated step of the left neighbour of the path. if no left neighbour, we take the left side of the grid as a limit
            </li>
            <li>
                we take the rightStep, which is the actual not-yet calculated step of the right neighbour of the path.if no right neighbour, we take the the right side of the grid as a limit.
            </li>
            <li>
                we the randomly calculate the next step of the selected path, in the boundary of its neighbours...
            </li>
        </ul>
        -two special cases has been raised :<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                left path issue..
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the selected path and its left neighbour are on a same point .
                </li>
                <li>
                    the left path went on the right ( remember, steps calculus goes from left path to right path ) . .
                </li>
                <li>
                    the selected path goes awol OUTSIDE the left / right pathes boundaries...
                </li>
                <li>
                    selected path needs to follow its left neighbour, in order to avoid a crossing...
                </li>
            </ol>
            <li>
                The right grid border
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    selected path is on the right grid border.
                </li>
                <li>
                    its left neighbour went on right, on the right grid border
                </li>
                <li>
                    As in the algorithm, we consider that if the left path will share a point with the selected path, the selected path can go only straight , or on the right..
                </li>
                <li>
                    .. We need for the selected path to not go outside the grid.. And can only go straight in the case
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        - a new function has been added to handle the calculation of all the pathes steps,  called NEXTSTEPS...<br /><br />
        Of course comments in the js file if you wish to see it, but i suggest to see the refactored one on the next page!<br /><br />
